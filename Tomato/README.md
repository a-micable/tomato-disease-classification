Tomato Leaf Disease Classification Project
This project uses deep learning to identify nine tomato leaf diseases and determine if an image is a tomato leaf. Seven models were trained, with ResNet50 being the most effective. A FastAPI backend connects models to a ReactJS frontend, enabling real-time disease prediction. ExpressJS handles user authentication and data management. The frontend validates uploaded images to ensure they are tomato leaves. Deployed on Vercel (frontend), Render (ExpressJS API), and Hugging Face Spaces (FastAPI API).
